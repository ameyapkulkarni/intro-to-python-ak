# Pancake recipe

### Ingredients

1. 1 cup all-purpose flour
2. 2 tablespoons sugar
3. 1 teaspoon baking powder
4. 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
5. 1/4 teaspoon salt
6. 1 cup buttermilk
7. 1 large egg
8. 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
9. Cooking spray or additional butter for greasing

    
### Cooking Instructions

1. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.
2. In a separate bowl, beat the egg and then add the buttermilk and melted butter. Whisk until well combined.
3. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients. Stir gently until just combined. ***NOTE: Do not overmix; a few lumps are okay.***
4. Preheat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat. Lightly grease the surface with cooking spray or butter.
5. Pour 1/4 cup of batter onto the skillet for each pancake. Cook until bubbles form on the surface, about 2-3 minutes.
6. Flip the pancake and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes, or until golden brown.
7. Transfer the cooked pancakes to a plate and cover with a clean kitchen towel to keep warm.
8. Repeat the process with the remaining batter, adding more cooking spray or butter as needed.
9. Serve the pancakes warm with your favorite toppings such as maple syrup, fresh fruits, or whipped cream.
